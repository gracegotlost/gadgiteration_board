#The NoiseMaker 2.1

## 2014.3.8 BCAL Workshop

### What else to take for next workshop?
1.solder and solder iron
2.pre hot glue wires in their weaker points
3.check battery before
4.bring wires of various types: hook-up wires, female-female headers, male-male headers¡­
5.make light/sound extendable

### Good things
1.scavenger hunt to give some science and match this to the understanding of the board later
2.new board with new functions: input and light

### Suggestion
1.scavenger hunt before lecture, demystify the components

### Bad things
1.adequate sneaks, scissors
2.instructions about screw drills
3.some students asked for magnets to connect things
*button mode: when pushing green buttons it immediately works instead of ¡°off¡± mode because students will think it¡¯s broken
*just one music or multiple music with different themes

### Software
1.change LED stripe to rainbow mode under human circuit mode
2.different TYPES of music
3.use digitalRead pins for analog inputs

### Hardware
1.solder wires under the board
2.if we won¡¯t use the battery jack, change the holes smaller for battery wires
3.reduce inputs to one
4.put alligator clip aside of human circuit pads
5.add screws to stabilize the board
